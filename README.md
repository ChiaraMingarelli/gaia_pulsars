# gaia_pulsars

Here we look at the white dwarf companion to IPTA millisecond pulsars.
Our long-term goal is to achieve pc-scale distance measurements to the pulsars in order to do gravitational-wave interferometry, get better constraints on fuzzy (light axionic) dark matter, and tests of GR via binary pulsars.

Here we give all the codes to reproduce the results in Mingarelli, Anderson, Bedell and Spergel. Please cite our paper when you use our code.

In order to do the pulsar cross-match, see our other repo: gaia_xmatch.
